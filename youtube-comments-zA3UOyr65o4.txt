1. Weird horses
2. I love how once the laughter starts, that one lifts their head like, “What’s that noise? It was so quiet a second ago.”
3. Never once searched for a borzoi but the algorithm decided to inundate my feed with borzois
4. heaven forbid anyone cross-breed this one with a Husky, we'd never get any sleep ever from all the singing XD
5. I love how the howling session was sputtering out towards the end and a couple of them try to keep it going only to stop when they realized the others were done.
6. What a nice collection of singing sock puppets
7. Translation: "Didn't I do it for you"
8. Russian singing horses
9. Didn't I do it for you
10. The nest stirs.
11. “Why are you laughing?? This is a sacred tradition amongst our people!”
12. The neighbors must be overjoyed.
13. i've never seen an animal so beautiful yet so hilarious at the same time
14. I can’t get over how magical their snoots are
15. Having this many of them in one place is dangerous, anymore of them and the entire room would have collapsed from the concentration of pure silliness alone
16. I play this at 4:30 am to wake up my two Borzois for morning patrol.  They howl along with it while spinning.
17. The internet becoming obsessed with these weird, derpy, high-energy horse dogs has greatly enriched my life. Carry on.
18. 0:18 the rhino painting looks sick!
19. One of them actually sounds really good, just can't figure out which one lol
20. Very beautiful dogs. I'm sure they're a treat to be around, but how do you get any sleep?

112.  @galedribble9535  lmao I experienced the same thing with Pallas cats a few months ago
113. me too!
114. >implying that’s a bad thing
115.  @kawaiipastaaaa6819  no it’s a pretty great thing
116. Am I the only one who actually looked up borzoi?
117. Me too ,suddenly showed up ,but I keep clicking on them all anyway
118. This is exactly my situation
119. Borbois. Good borbois.
120. Looks like someone is havin a good day.
121.  @wynngwynn  can't tell if genuine question, but they're a type of "sight hound." Dogs bred for a short, quick burst of speed to catch quick hunt prey like rabbits.
Think greyhound but looooooooooomg boi.
122. This is the way.

125. Same here. But I love em
126. Same
127. Same here too
128. Me too lol, I actually didn't know that's what this type of dog was called
129. Lmao YES pallas cats and borzois
130. I’m glad it did because I didn’t even know these existed and now I want one, and usually I’ve never felt that way about a dog
131. Same
132. Same! Not mad about it though
133. Seriously like what does this mean. Didn’t even know this dog existed
134. same to me
135. Same, I don't even know about them
136. Me too. Did we find the edge of the internets?
137. Yep same!
138. same, it’s spooky
139. Why is YouTube giving borzoi videos
140. And it was the best decision it could’ve made
141. Same...
142. HAH
same
143. I actually searched for them like 12 days ago just saying....
144. I'm here now.
145. It suggested one borzoi video a week ago and I watched it. Now it has decided that I want to see all the borzoi videos. And it's right, I do.
146. Same but I'm not complaining
147. Same
148. Same!
149. same you may know about the horse meme too by now
150. Same
151. same
152. same
153. Me too
154. if you whatched a meme compilation with a wierd looking noodle face dog in it the algorithm recognised the image of that dog as something youre interested in. and as such, tried its luck. and succeeded, because you clicked on it. All Hail The Algorithm.
155. And now I want one 🥺
156. click on one video with a borzoi in it
Youtube algorithm: "don't worry fam I gotchu"
157. oh i very much searched for this
158. i thought they were a sheep or smth
159. A week ago I was mindlessly scrolling through YouTube to find a borzoi video out of nowhere. I thought “this dog has a long face, time to call it a horse”. Now I regularly get borzoi videos recommended to me and I love it.
160. Just learned what they are, I’m still traumatized by their angular figures
161. I got suggested a video out of no where, clicked on it thinking what on earth is this ridiculous looking animal now they're everywhere
162. Yeah, me too.
163. Mine too and I am HERE for it :D
164. Same
165. same
166. The nose knows.
167. Me too and I am not complaining—
168. good
169. Thats a good thing
170.  @wynngwynn  Obviously howling horses
171. The algorithm was like "Let me do it for you"
172. Didn't I do it for you?
173. same they're cute though
174. Same, and I ain't even mad!
175. Same!!!
176. Same.
177.  @wynngwynn  weird horses
178.  @galedribble9535  The cat is round and the dog is long.
179. Why head so long?
180. same lol
181. Same
182. Observing Borzois is not a individual choice made of ones free will, neigh, it is a requirement, or perhaps obligation, of every man, woman and child in the modern day.
183. Same thing happened here.
184. Same
185. Algorithm: Let me do it for you…
186. Youtube: "LET ME DO IT FOR YOU!"
187.  @munt368  With me, it's cheetahs.
188. Same. I had never heard of this breed, and then the memes just exploded.

As one person noted, this breed is simultaneously beautiful AND hilarious.
189.  @galedribble9535  

You too? I've been flooded by Pallas' Cats for weeks, if not momths!
190. Same and now I want one lol
191.  @reclusiarchgrimaldus1269  Amen💗
192. Same. But I love it
193. Welcome to the cult you are not allowed to leave
194. Right😂😂
195. It just showed in my recommendations tab and here I am
196. Random pack event
197. I’ve never did either, until YT started recommending me some videos about them because of the “didn’t I do it for you?” meme XD
198. I'm loving it.  😂
199. "I never searched for a borzoi"
Algorithm: let me do it for you
200. Same
201. Good algorithm.
202. Same lol, but I'm fine with that
203.  @kawaiipastaaaa6819  Why would learning new amazing breeds and/or animals be a bad thing lol
204. As god intended
205. Borzoi-husky crossbreeds are a thing. They're just not common. No idea if they sing the song of their people though.
206.  @six-winged-juni  it’s a mixed howl
207.  @six-winged-juni  omg
 must be gorgeous~
208. Get them a few drinks, they'll be at it until sun up 🤪
209.  lonelypotato jin never found  exactly what i was referencing

219. That nearly game ended me. XD
220. AGREED
221. essence of borzoi
222. Hehe long snoot
223. look up owls, they're just dogs with wings
224. Yes!
225. the funniest part is these goofy furballs were bred in Russia as wolf hunting dogs.

These hilarious creatures were bred to kill wolves. And people just chill with them. And they just chill with people.
226. But they dont chill with wolves, which is the point 🙂  @lsswappedcessna 
227. I thought our Collie had a big nose.
228.  @wolkaiserdrake9946  I think u mean "cats" with wings.
229. Why the long face
230.  @Ash_G   que
231.  @heywhoisthisguy  why the Pencil neck
232. Didn’t I do it for you
233. Not magical, but unhealthy.
234.  @Sc0pee they were bred that way in order to hunt, it's not harmful to the dog lol-- a quick internet search will tell you the same thing
235. Boop!
236. big magic boop
237. I feel for your neighbors
238. That's adorable.
239.  @jasonwalker4003  Their neighbors feel for their earplugs...
240.  @jasonwalker4003  same
241.  @jasonwalker4003  Not everyone lives like a sardine.
242.  @girlbuu9403  i do and it sucks. wouldnt mind it if houses/apartments were properly noise isolated
243.  @girlbuu9403  For almost everyone, it's a choice between:
1. Living like a sardine in a flat.
2. Living in the middle of nowhere in a house.

Only very few people have a separate urban house in a serious city.
244.  @Humanophage  Urban or suburban housing would also be a nightmare hearing this. 

I am #2 and would only hear my neighbors dogs doing this if the power was out and all was deadly silent, and then faintly, or if I was outside.
245. lol
246.  @girlbuu9403  Not Everyone lives in the middle of nowhere
247.  @apassionatenerd.3564  i c wut u did thar
248.  @girlbuu9403 not everyone lives
249.  @girlbuu9403  not everyone
250. Your neighbors must be thrilled.
251. Apparently, the high energy thing is intentional.

Someone here said that Borzoi dogs have the same niche as greyhounds "BUT LOOONG BOI".
252. Borzoi are among the laziest dogs.
Yes, they need to run but after that short spurt of energy, they sleep like 19 hours a day.
253. really sick of the people calling them weird 😐
254.  @thea_therian  Weird in the best way possible
255. ​ @TurtleShroom3  they were originally bred to hunt wolves
256.  @sarab3888  

Correct.
257. ​ @sarab3888 not wolfs, rabbits
258. 109367 the white one i think
259. They’re harmonising, it’s not just one of them x}
260. You mean the one that looks like a borzoi?
261.  @diegoalbertoalejandrogonza6322  lol 😂
262. I think the white one and the one with the grey face are either harmonizing or one of them is the good singer
263. Trick question: She doesn't
264.  @Lunar994  Another trick question: so does her neighbor
265. How do the neighbour's sleep 🤔😆
266. You gain: majestic regal looking dogs. You lose: Sleep
267.  Sofia K  I agree. Where I'm from the landlord needs to allow you having a dog. And I doubt any landlord in the world would allow this.
268.  Sofia K  i mean, I live in a house and I hear my neighbors' dogs screaming everynight (I'm use too it, because I also have a dog who barks at night, so it doesn't bother me. I'm just saying that just because you have a private house, it doesn't mean you cant hear the dogs bark, or the neighbors yelling about getting a divorce, and someone blasting music at 3 am)
269. Sleep?
270. I live very rural, only a neighbor on one side and not close. They howl like this because we have a big pack of coyotes that start them up. It’s short lived and I actually love it!
271.  Sofia K  trust me, man, I've lived in apartment to apartment for 11 years. Our last apartment's walls were paper thin too. I'm just saying, that no matter were you live (unless you live in the middle of nowhere), you'll always get loud neighbors no matter what
272.  @sataraborzoi4469  I herd from a ranger that, if you make loud noises, you'll scare the coyotes out of that area. Time to help make loud noises everytime their near by
273. She eats them one by one.
274. They need a city ordinance against her.
275.  Sofia K  bruh do you live in the uk. You got a loud loiscence?
276. Heroin and xanax
277.  @Mrs.Jekyll  I have dogs to but my neighbor basically have an entire pack and them screaming all night make me one to go out and burn down their houses. My dogs and the other neighbors' are that crazy screaming. Theirs seem to be untrainable, I would sometimes hear them screaming as well trying to shut their dogs up.
278. "Thats the neat part, you don't"
279.  @Mrs.Jekyll  why? it's their ecosystem!
280.  Sofia K  I live in an old house where the newer house they joined next to us was obviously built wrong because the walls are so thin you can hear them boiling the kettle, or taking a shower, or sometimes even going to the toilet.
Apartments are made to have thin walls so that is why they tell people to refrain from making a shit tonne of noise but still, people don't give a shit.
281.  Sofia K  uhhhm that's not how it works.. If you are in the UK then they would have to make a diary on every time you made TOO much noise and then they would contact the police.. You don't find many who actually get into trouble about noise because people cannot be asked to go out of their way making notes and recording it etc..

Edit: not to mention they cannot do jack shit about how late you shower unless you live in an apartment complex where they stated set rules before you moved in.
282.  @Mrs.Jekyll  You can't hear from one house to the other unless both have their windows open. It doesn't compare to a flat
283.  @Mrs.Jekyll  yeah you can get unlucky and live next to an inconsiderate neighbor that is incompetent and doesn’t train their dog.
284. Yea I'd hate to live next to these guys
285. When that dog you drew as a kid has a family
286. Listen...I know this video is 6yrs old. But I'm going through some tough emotional times, and this video gave me a very necessary laugh. Thank you... really
287. Borzois are so goofy. I remember one that would be digging a hole in the backyard, and it was so deep she would just go in there and you wouldnt see her. Very adorable
288. LET ME DO IT FOR YOUUUUUUUUUUUU , KERMIEEEEEEEE
289. Dear god, they’re just as noisy as huskies
290. ma'am, your horses are howling
291. The council disapproves of your motion.
292. Howling party….bring your own howls 🤣🤣🤣🤣
293. The neighbor must be so happy to hear these lovely dogs!
294. Beautiful horses
295. Now THIS is the best edit, the fact that Jerma became a dog and it looks so realistic. incredible.
296. Most talkative pack of horsedogs I've ever seen
297. Translation: Didn't I do it for you?
298. Just imagine how terrifying years ago it must have been if you were a wolf,  going for a walk in the morning and hearing that sound coming out of the fog at you...
299. this is my favorite jerma video
300. loved jerma's performance in this one
301. Legend has it the constant howling caused their noses to elongate.
302. They started howling and next thing that happens is my furniture starts floating, my cat starts walking on the ceiling and a random black goat appears in front of my doorway.
303. I love how dogs (and wolves) lift their heads and tilt them back to howl.
304. I love how they communicate. It’s dogs way of talking to us about what’s going on with their feelings. Love it!
305. Highly underrated comment!😂
306. top kek
307. It's not goofy, bro, she was just scared
308.  @mnemonicpie  You look like some austrian painter
309.  @basolarte thats stalin lmao
310. ​ @brantlyb2b35 think that is Omniman in Stalins uniform
311. ​ @mnemonicpie  i doubt it if she would just zoom around out back then go straight in that hole, then zip back out. That dog was goofy as heck
312. But so much fancier!
313. They’re howling with top hats and holding cups of tea
314. Much less frequently as loud as huskies, though ;)
315.  @amaya2728  much more a glass of vodka and balalaika
316. Huskies  🤝  Borzoi
Russian dogs that make a lot of noise and look cool
317. Husky Greyhound
318. My Beagle/JRT/Dachshund mix is pretty noisy when she wants to be.
319.  @zhuzhick  
Don’t forget the Beluga Caviar.
320. I saw this comic where a wolf saw a borzoi for the first time and it was like a human reacting to a fucked up goblin
321. Nit to mention that they look like eldritch horror, so seeing one from wolf's perspective would be kinda same as seeing vendigo or scp-096 for a human
322.  @BingQilin  can i see it
323.  @ДимаВеселов-в8и  Vicar Amelia
324.  @MaimaiKuroshiro  It's called 'We Must Not Look at Goblin Men' by Holly Lucero
325.  @Euqoram  got it, thanks!
326. Nah they come out of the woods and it's just some tame long nose bois if I were a wolf I'd be wheezing with laughter, personally
327. Years ago when wolfs were hunting all over Europe a full size Wolf would have 3x times the mass of this dogs, wolf can eat  up to 20kg(40pounds) of meat and they would hunt in huge pack that could easly kill even a adult horse...
328.  @BingQilin sauce???!!
329.  @Bialy_1 That’s why hunting dogs are also kept in packs. Usually people didn’t hunt packs of wolves either, since wolf packs stay far from humans since wolves are very skittish. People would hunt rogue wolves that were terrorizing livestock.
330. ⁠ @Bialy_1 that’s nice and all but these things were bred to kill those same wolves, they’re literally born for it
331. Despicable, but, accurate 😬
332. Wtf is a jerma
333. Cringe.
334. why are comments mentioning jerma? are people from an alternate universe where this is jerma's real form slipping through the cracks of reality?
335. ​@PerfectAzrael  this is from 2 years ago.
336. @PerfectAzrael You have an AI generated mechanized picture of Azrael from Undertale. Really bold to call something else 'cringe'
337. If I remember correctly it has to do with pushing the air out and making a louder noise, also something to do with it making the sound travel farther iirc!
338.  @exist4046  Nah they do it cause it's cute.
339. They are so precious <3
340. Ah, what a lovely melody (unironic)
341. Thank you youtube for recommending me this video 7 years later...
342. The neighbor to his wife while this is happening: Dorothy! Find us a new house we can move into by next week!!
343. "Alright boys, I think we can give those huskies down the street a run for their money!"
344. You probably don't get this enough, but it is very commendable for you to be able to raise so many of these dogs so well and for them to be seemingly all healthy too. I have a friend who seemingly breaks her back for her one Borzoi, I couldn't imagine taking care of 4 of them.
345. "Lemme do it for yoou"
346. When you say the word "walk" within a hundred mile radius of a dog:
347. Love how it just jumps into the howling. No build up just straight to the point
348. Dang those horses are really putting on a show for us.
349. i love how all of them became quiet at the same time
350. They’re all singing, “Let me do it for you.” 😅
351. Two pairs of socks howling.
352. 30: That's the sound of forgiveness. Screaming and then silence.
353. Next up:  We find out how much the neighbors love Borzoi...
354. They've got what it takes to be a great choir, all they need is a conductor to help arrange their harmonies
355. "Didn't I do it for you"
356. It's not only the call of wild Borzoi.  While watching the video, my German Shepherd joined in on their call.
357. Those are some sharp looking dogs
358. I had no idea coyotes could train choirs! Beautiful dogs!
359. Underated comment
360. Dorothy is the most neighbor-wifiest name ever!
361. Dorothy, get the chocolate
362.  @jeanxza5395  noooo I have a borzoi myself…no one who’s met a borzoi would do that! they’re the sweetest and borzoi are so big chocolate would only kill them in very large amounts
363. top kek.
364. I saved this magical song into my favorite songs playlist
365. Choir of hose goats, pure bliss to the ears.
366. [The bed is now cursed]
367. May your enemies flee in terror upon hearing these terrible war cries.
368. Jerma really doesnt show Otto enough, he's grown SO much and also split into several entities??
369. Such beautiful creatures, so stunning, with voices of an angel!
370. translation : "didn't I do it for you, didn't I do it for you, kermie?"
371. Best acapelle I have ever heard.
372. it never occurred to me that borzois made noise. i always thought of them as silent, stoic creatures more focused on observing the world they live in
373. I love at the end how they were all just suddenly done LOL
374. Owner: Ugh my bestie wont call me.
The dogs: Let me do it for you~ Howls
375. Best singing!! ❤❤❤ Apparently they are saying ‘I’m over here!’  Facts.
376. Huskies are loud and obnoxious. 
Borzoi: hold my beer
377. Sings... didn't i howl for you
378. cant wait for there opera debut
379. This is just like the scene from The Lady and the Tramp when Lady arrives at the pound. These dogs could've done such a good job in the scene, really. They're natural singers
380. That's a purrfect symphony!! 💗💗😍😍🥰💗
381. great jerma video
382. I suddenly became obsessed with this breed of dog. The inner Russian in me jumped tf out lol
383. Redditors when they find out Borzois don't actually say "Didn't I do it for you"
384. Awww, yeahhh. I was thinking of the pound scene with Rowlf from Muppets Take Manhattan.✨🎬🐶🌃🗽✨
385. Good trumpet wolves!
386. Fourzoi
387. Man, I worry I'd be awful at taking care of just one dog and here you are with several!
388. I played this for my hound mix and after a moment of confusion, she started howling along too
389. Hell sounds exactly like this
390. What a beautiful song!!
391. "Lemme do it for you"
392. This reminds me of 101 Dalmatians! Where they all start howling 😄
393. The minions when Gru walks into a room
394. What beautiful singing
395. They say " let me do it for you!"
396. They found out the meme died
397. they're harmonizing ❤️
398. We're watching a movie. Get us some crotch-flavored popcorn.
399. They're singing - "DIDN'T I DO IT FOR YOUUU"!!
400. Someone must have dropped a quite good "yo mama" joke.
401. " we will do it for you "
402. They did it for us .
403. Looks like they had a lot to say 🤣
404. I love Jerma
405. The last thing a pit bull hears
406. “Didn’t I do it for you..?”
407. The sound that strikes fear into the hearts of lone wolves.
408. Borzois are so gangly and awkward

I want 20 of them
409. Lyrics- 
Didn’t I do it for you
Didn’t I do it for you 
When all I do is for you
Kermie
410. It is 3am and you have awoken my dogs. I hope you're happy.
411. If you listen closely, you can hear them saying “didn’t I do it for you”
412. That is too adorable! 😁
413. I think they're saying: "Let me do it for you."
414. everytime a sock gets a hole the borzois sing
415. Hilarious and lovely all at once. The pack is so in sync. Is that your bed.. or theirs? LOL. Our dogs and cats and misc over the years always share our beds. Sometimes they are not very fair sharers. I end up on the floor a couple times a month. And right now its only my newest rescue. She is a Chihuahua/Greyhound cross. Bit of a strange little doggo. Very long legs and body but tiny little head with big adorable floppy ears. She howls. And howls. And occasionally barks and growls, mainly at my youngest grandson because he scared the s*it out of her the day they met. Literally. I played this for her trying to get her to join in, with me howling too, but she just put her head down and stared at me. Not sure what that was about unless your doggies were swearing in Borzoi? At the coyotes?😈🤣🐾 Thank you for sharing them. A friend years ago had one of those that looks so much like these guys. And dammit my screwy brain can't remember the breed! Very regal and beautiful. He pampered that dog like nobody's business. Her name was Athena. Perfect.😉 Wait! Is it an Afghan Hound? I think so. The long silky coat that he brushed 10xs a day? Yeah.
416. a beautiful symphony
417. Such a majestic animal
418. If this doesn't put a smile on your face, you have no soul.
419. My soul when mom says its time to wake up and go to school
420. Wolves really did evolve into a superior product.
421. You were  n e a r l y  harmonising.
...lets take it again from the top...
5, 6, 7, 8...
422. I love borzois, my 1,5 year old boy is so silent, he does not bark and honestly he's more like a cat than a dog but the second he hears howling or even if I howl at him for a few seconds, he starts howling like a maniac, he's the best. Really recommend this breed if you can just deal with the shedding and the howling
423. If I were their neighbor, I certainly could never be annoyed. Stunning vocals.
424. You hear that? That's the sound of neighborhood property values falling.
425. SOME OF US NEED TO SLEEEEEEEEEEP!
426. You definitely would be though.
427. 0:33 “how dare you laugh at the song of my people!”
428. Music to my ears.

442. God dang it. I rest at a bonfire for literally 2 seconds just to refill my glowing water bottles and these things respawn.
443. Beautiful chorus!
444. Your domesticated skinwalkers are very cute! :D
445. Theyre probably all singing “LeT mE dO iT fOr YoU”
446. Your neighbors must be very happy
447. Added this to my favourite songs playlist
448. Greyhounds do exactly the same thing.  It’s called “rooing”.

513. The council has spoken
514. This gives me serotonin.
515. I can smell that house from here
516. Man, someone just decided to retcon IRL lore and added a new breed of dog that's supposedly "already existed for years" yet nobody's seen them until last year and now they're everywhere

I'm not complaining though, I love borzois
517. They sound like bagpipes, which is somehow quite fitting. The most awkward of doggies, sounds like the most awkward of instruments.
518. Love it...borzois heaven 🥰🤗

524. They are cute pups with pencils for noses and I CANNOT CONTAIN MYSELF .❤❤❤❤
525. "Ill call you back, my horses are barking"
526. This actually remineded me of a contemporary abstract choral piece I heard once.   They just need to learn to keep focused on the conductor more.
527. They look like sad sock puppets and I love them
528. Music to the ears! 🐾🎶
529. I'm so glad this was suggested for me.😂
530. This is what brotherhood is about

534. The long socks have spoken….winter is coming

611. This is what Tsar Nicholas hears when Rasputin is staying over.













-

I had never heard of Borzoi dogs until a few weeks ago because of the memes.

As it turns out, they were actually THE dog owned by Russian nobility, and they were almost made extinct by the Soviets because of that association.
612. I'm glad my patronus is a borzoi
(for context I gotten a Harry Potter app and did all the quizzes to discover my Harrypotterness)
